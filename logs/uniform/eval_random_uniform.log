Starting PWM Model Evaluation...
Reading test sequences from: data/splits/random/test_sequences.fasta 
Found 48 test sequences with labels.
Looking for PWM models ( ^null_random_uniform.rds$ ) in: results 
Found 1 model(s) to evaluate.

Evaluating model: null_random_uniform.rds 
  PWM length: 82 
  Scored 48 out of 48 sequences (matching PWM length).
  AUC: 0.5000
