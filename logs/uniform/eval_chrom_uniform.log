Starting PWM Model Evaluation...
Reading test sequences from: data/splits/chrom/test_sequences.fasta 
Found 15 test sequences with labels.
Looking for PWM models ( ^null_chrom_uniform.rds$ ) in: results 
Found 1 model(s) to evaluate.

Evaluating model: null_chrom_uniform.rds 
  PWM length: 82 
  Scored 15 out of 15 sequences (matching PWM length).
  Skipping ROC/AUC calculation: Need at least two scored sequences with both positive and negative labels.
